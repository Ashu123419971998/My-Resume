    <H2>Summary</H2>
    <p>Software Development Engineer with over three years of experience in a product-centric company, I have specialized in developing robust solutions for telecom operators to facilitate seamless customer transactions. My expertise lies in end-to-end transaction flow development, leveraging Java and Spring Boot frameworks, and creating both RESTful and SOAP web services. I used JUnit and Mockito to ensure thorough coverage of all scenarios, including edge cases. This meticulous attention to detail has consistently resulted in highly reliable and efficient features.
        <br>
        Furthermore, I have engineered Docker containers for multiple components and coordinated with the operations team during UAT to identify and rectify bugs efficiently. I have successfully led more than three project releases, coordinating effectively with five internal teams to ensure smooth delivery. This experience has developed my project management and cross-functional collaboration abilities. Additionally, I have cultivated strong client relationship management abilities, engaging directly with customers to gather business requirements and architect tailored solutions.
